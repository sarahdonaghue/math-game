This was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is a Math Game that checks how well the users know their multiplication tables up to 10.

Each question is a multiple question operation consisting of numbers between 1 and 10. 

There are multiple choice answers.

If the answer is correct a new question appears and the score goes up by 10.

If the answer is wrong, you get a red "try again" message. The game won't continue until the correct answer is chosen.

You can reset the game at any time.

There is a time limit.

When the game is over, you will get a message saying "Game Over!" with your score.
